title: PyCon AU over for another year
---

PyCon AU 2019 is all done. 

692 people registered to be a part of the event, and we saw 121 speakers (including 9 students and 25 lightning talks) over 5 days, speaking about all manner of things Python and technology. 

We were also able to host 11 children in our on-site childcare, and get our videos uploaded in another record time. [You can see our 2019 videos on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs4CJRBY5F1LKqauI3V4E_xflt6Gow611)
